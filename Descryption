• Implemented S-box modifications in the PRESENT lightweight block cipher and analyzed cryptographic behavior.
• Encrypted CIFAR-10 dataset using modified PRESENT cipher variants and visualized channel-level changes in
image structure.
• Trained deep CNN architectures (AlexNet, MobileNet) to classify encryption variants, performing closed-set classi-
fication with high accuracy.
• Explored open-set classification using activation vector-based rejection (OpenMax) to detect unknown cipher pat-
terns
